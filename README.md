# app_backend
This will be the backend repo for my project
For this project, I will build an e-commerce full stack application API that allows users to perform various CRUD operations. The objectives are as follows:
- Build a full stack application using Node.js, Postgres and Express
- Allow users to register and log in 
- Allow CRUD on products in the online store
- Allow CRUD on user accounts
- Allow CRUD on user carts
- Allow a user to place an order

The technologies I will be using are:
- Javascript
- Express
- Node.js
- Postgres
- HTML /CSS

The application will be developed on my local machine with the expectation to be deployed to the internet using Heroku (i think thats what was said in class?)

USER STORIES
When I load the app into a browser, I can create a user account with a username and password
when I create an account, I can view products
when I see a product I like, I can select it, add it to a cart
when I am ready to checkout with my product(s) in my cart, I can place an order
If I no longer want a product, I can delete it from my cart

STRECH GOALS
Ability to "favorite" products a user likes
Ability to update user account info
ability to save "payment methods" for later use
